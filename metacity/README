metacity (a lightweight window manager)

Metacity is implemented with the GTK+ 2.x toolkit and integrates well with
GNOME 2.x platform.  This adds a window border to every GTK application.
Without this, cairo window border theme will appear.
 
This requires GConf, zenity, and libcanberra.
GConf is in slackware /extra repository as well as slackbuilds.org.
