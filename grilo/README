Grilo is a framework focused on making media discovery and browsing easy for application developers.

More precisely, Grilo provides:

    A single, high-level API that abstracts the differences among various media content providers, allowing application developers to integrate content from various services and sources easily.
    A collection of plugins for accessing content from various media providers. Developers can share efforts and code by writing plugins for the framework that are application agnostic.
    A flexible API that allows plugin developers to write plugins of various kinds. 

At this moment, Grilo has plugins supporting various services, including:

    YouTube
    Jamendo
